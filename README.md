# Positive Mean Main Diagonal Matrix Transformation

This Python script takes input for a square matrix, calculates the mean of positive numbers in each column, and replaces the main diagonal elements with these means, creating a new matrix.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yesrkaya/positive-mean-main-diagonal.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd positive-mean-main-diagonal
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python data-lab3.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the size and elements of the matrix.

## Example

Suppose the user inputs the following matrix:

```
3
Enter the size of the matrix: 2
Enter an element: 1
Enter an element: 3
Enter an element: 2
Enter an element: 4
```

The resulting transformed matrix would be:

```
1.5 3.0
2.0 3.5
```
